"Find Emma!" is a Birthday present for my wife, Emma.

It is a retro style text adventure game in the ilk of [Zork]`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork` and [Colossal Cave Adventure]`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure`.

It's about a little doggy who has to feed animials in the garden, open presents, eat snacks, and ultimately find her carer and best pal, Emma! The whole game is based on a dog we're (currently) fostering and our village home in South Wales, UK.

"Find Emma!" may be played online at [http://findemma.fantomfactory.org/]`http://findemma.fantomfactory.org/`.
